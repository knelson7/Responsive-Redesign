        <div class='paragraph'>
          <p>
            The goal of this project was to practice the workflow of redesigning a simple website. 
            Through this project, I gained the skills necessary to analyze and identify flaws in an existing interface, 
            create low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for various screen sizes, and build a responsive website
            based on those prototypes.

            providing them with 
            helpfpul resources, and harboring a strong sense of community.

          <h4>Interface Problems</h4>
        </div>
        <div class='list'>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Typeface: the typeface is legible, but 
              the random and inconsistent differences in weighting and size 
              is distracting and doesn’t inform the hierarchy
            </li>
            <li>
                Structure and Layout: there is not structure to
               the website besides the table. Pieces of information are slapped 
               onto the page with no underlying foundation, structure, or order
            </li>
            <li>
              White Space: white space is not used effectively with 
              some sections of the webpage displaying dense amounts of text while 
              other sections have little to no text
            </li>
            <li>
              Color: the use of color is sporadic, random, and inconsistent. The green and yellow 
              displayed on the page doesn’t help the reader’s eyes focus on important pieces of information
            </li>
            <li>
              Other notes: there are duplicate pieces of information (such as the link to San Mateo 
              County’s official website), the random urls outside of the main table throw off any organization 
              that the table tries to provide
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

          <h4>Accessibility Concerns</h4>
        </div>
        <div class='paragraph'>
          <p>
            WebAIM WAVE detected many possible accessibility concerns including the following: 
            the language of the document wasn’t identified, the page has no headings, no page 
            regions or ARIA landmarks were found, and the contrast between the green text and the 
            background color was very low. Lastly it found that the link text contained extraneous text that may not 
            make sense out of context. 
          </p>
          <p>
            When using NVDA on the website, it would sometimes say “blank” instead of reading the next piece of 
            text on the page. This is probably due to the website’s poor layout and 
            structural issues. The screen reader interpreted the table of hyperlinks quite well, 
            correctly notifying users when it switched to the next column.

            This website is dedicated to San Mateo County citizens as a way of informing them of current events, providing them with

            My redesigned website changes based on the size of the browser window. Most notably, the picture of San Mateo County City Hall
            gets bigger or smaller to fill up the correct amount of available space, while still displaying the full image. Additionally, the number of 
            columns in the flexbox changes. On a full sized laptop screen, the browser shows 4 columns, with an iPad sized screen showing 2 columns,
            and an iPhone screen showing only a single column. When I changed the font size of my browser window to be as large as possible, it showed 
            3 columns. My website's improvements were highlihgted by changing the langauge of the website since the new structure and heirarchies that 
            I put in place greatly inform where the user can click and what content is grouped together.
